Hummingbirds are the smallest birds known to exist, yet that doesn't stop them from flying fast. These little birds can be
found in jungles, meadows, flower forests and sunflower biomes. The one thing that can calm these critters - flowers. Hummingbirds are
intense pollinators of crops and flowers during the day, and are even better at it than bees. They can be bred with flowers.
They seem to be attracted to flutters, mistaking them for being flowers due to the flutter's top blossoms.
Hummingbird feeders can be crafted and filled with both Water Bottles and Sugar in order to keep hummingbirds in a small area - and boost the effects of their pollination.
