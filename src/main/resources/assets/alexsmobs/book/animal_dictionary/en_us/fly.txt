Flies are small, annoying insects common in the overworld. They are observed to be naturally attracted to odorous things, be it dead or smelly things,
however they seem to be deterred from the smell of the waxy candles as it seems to irritate their senses.
Flies can be bred with rotten flesh, and on death have a possibility to drop maggots.
Fly Maggots can be used to breed other creatures, like Roadrunners and Capuchin Monkeys, and, in a pinch, used as
a revolting light snack.

The fly seems to have an anomalous feature where it can transform into a Crimson Mosquito under certain conditions, the first is when it happens to find itself upon the Nether Dimension,
its body mutates upon the nether's atmosphere and transmogrify into one
<NEWLINE>
The second is a more intentional transformation where one must first weaken the fly to weaken its immune system,
then it is to be bathed in blood, then finally is to be fed a fungal ingredient, and will then cause it to transform into such.
